# Neural-Network-Classifier-CIFAR-100-

## Abstract

Neural Network is one of the most advance and most used method in the machine learning
community to create a classifier model. However, most classifier models created currently are
created for datasets that are very large and informative. This report would like to explore the use
and creation of classifier models that would perform relatively well on a small dataset such as
CIFAR-100. This report would argue on how a simple neural network would be as useful when in
comparison to a deep neural network on classifying datasets that are not too complicated. The
three neural network algorithms used in this experiment are a base CNN, an AlexNet-base CNN,
and a Residual Network with 14 layers (ResNet-14). In the result it shows that a simple baseline
CNN is able to gain similar accuracy results as a more complex algorithm such as ResNet-14, as
the more complex model would suffer from overfitting due to small dataset. This shows that simple
CNN are still essentially useful, especially for beginners to learn and apply on datasets that are
relatively small.
